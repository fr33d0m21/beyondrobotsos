# Beyond Robots OS

## Introduction
Beyond Robots OS is an open-source cognitive robot operating system built with AI and a conscious, designed to facilitate complex autonomous interactions. This system stands out by enabling dynamic speech and decision-making, closely mimicking human cognitive processes.

## Features
- **Dynamic Speech**: Enables continuous, context-influenced speaking, moving beyond the reactive nature of standard LLMs.
- **Live Visual Capabilities**: Integrates visual data, influencing the system's thoughts and behavior in real-time.
- **External Categorized Memory**: Manages memory dynamically, selecting the most relevant information for writing and retrieval.
- **Evolving Personality**: Adapts behavior, speech frequency, and style based on stored experiences and interactions.

## How it Works
Beyond Robots OS operates through an orchestrated collection of specialized LLM modules, each fulfilling a distinct role in the system. The primary modules include Thought, Consciousness, Subconsciousness, Answer, Memory_Read, Memory_Write, Memory_Select, and Vision.

### Module Workflow
- **GPT-4 Vision**: Begins the loop with visual processing.
- **Subconsciousness Module**: Processes visual/user input and context, generating emotional and contextual descriptions.
- **Memory_Read Module**: Analyzes context and provides relevant memory sections.
- **Consciousness Module**: Decides on actions (speaking or thinking) based on the analyzed context.
- **Thought Module**: Generates rational thoughts upon receiving commands.
- **Answer Module**: Composes responses based on the system's thoughts.
- **Memory_Write Module**: Transfers data from Short-Term Memory to Long-Term Memory as needed.

### Memory Structure
- **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Stores recent user interactions, system responses, and thoughts.
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Contains denser knowledge and information abstracted from STM.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone [repository URL]
cd Beyond-Robots-OS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Start the system using:
```bash
python main.py
```
Interact with Beyond Robots OS through the terminal or the Flask web interface.

## Improvement and Customization
- Customize and enhance the system by tweaking modules, their organization, and prompts.
- Consider developing smaller, specialized models for each module for improved performance.
